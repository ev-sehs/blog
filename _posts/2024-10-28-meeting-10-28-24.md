**Performance Overview**
- The fund has underperformed relative to the market.
- Current investments include:
  - **Microsoft**: Our largest and most stable asset.
  - **Six Flags**: Underperforming; we are considering divestment.
  - **Yum! Brands**: Minimal returns ($20); potential for sale due to poor performance.
  - **Chipotle**: Recently acquired, but we may explore alternatives as it has not shown significant growth.

**Cash and Assets**
- We currently have approximately $7,000 in stagnant funds available for reinvestment.

**Investment Changes**
- Recommendations to sell:
  - **Yum! Brands**: Underperforming and not aligned with current market trends.
  - **Six Flags**: Continued underperformance warrants reconsideration.

**Potential Investments**
- **Disney**: 
  - Pros: Innovative rides and technology integration.
  - Cons: Shrinking incomes may deter visitors; media costs are high.
  
- **Micron Technologies** (Proposed by James Sellers):
  - Focuses on memory and storage solutions, particularly in the semiconductor industry.
  - Key products include DRAM and NAND technologies.
  - Recent trends show a resurgence in demand, particularly related to AI advancements.
  
- **Competitors**: Notable competitors include Samsung and SK Hynix, which are also innovating in the memory space.

**Final Suggestions**
