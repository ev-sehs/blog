# Exciting Times Ahead- Stock Market Challenge and Entrepreneurial Programs

As we kick off the new year, our school is buzzing with anticipation for some thrilling events and programs. Let's dive into the highlights from our recent meeting on January 7, 2025.

## Stock Market Challenge: Get Ready to Invest!

Mark your calendars for **January 24th**, because that's when our Stock Market Challenge launches! We've set some ground rules to keep things fair and educational:

- **No shorting allowed**
- **"Limit trading"** enabled to prevent in-class trading

We're going all out with the advertising, so keep an eye out for posters and announcements. To make this challenge even more exciting, we're planning a kickoff event in **room 200/L201 with pizza**, a video explaining the logistics, and **Mr. Singh** himself walking us through the game.

## Entrepreneurial Opportunities Galore

But wait, there's more! We've got a lineup of programs that'll spark your entrepreneurial spirit:

1. **Veel Foundation's "Think Big Challenge"**: Write an essay for a chance to access real-world entrepreneurial resources.

2. **Hackathon**: Team up and brainstorm innovative business ideas in this team-based event.

3. **SDG Program**: Two lucky students will represent us in discussing European foundation protocol.

4. **Junior Idea Inspire**: A fun challenge to flex those entrepreneurial muscles.

## Stay Tuned

Keep your eyes peeled for more details on these upcoming events. With the Stock Market Challenge just around the corner and these fantastic programs lined up, 2025 is shaping up to be an exciting year for our club to grow!
